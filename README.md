# Basic Q-learning structure in c++

Project made to support implementation of Q-learning using C++. At first made a structure with a pure implementation, based on the Bellman equation.

The update function in the Qtablelearning class was made to run in a loop training interating with the agent with the environment. Outside of that can be made the loop to initializate the envoriment.

For the Qtablelearning is possible to save the Qtable in a file using the functions made for that.
